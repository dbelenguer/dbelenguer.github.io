## Professional experience

### Software Engineer at **Marfeel** - From February 2019 to June 2021 (2 years and a half)

At Marfeel I was part of one of the core platform teams where I was shipping performant, reliable and maintainable software that scales, moving fast without compromising neither quality nor requirements leveraging an extensive test suite and a powerful CI system to safely put in production several times a day, with ownership throughout the entire lifecycle of the feature as a core value.

When I started there was a monolith running the entire product serving 1B sessions per month and we started the refactoring to a microservices architecture and also creating a new product with it that revolutionize the way publishers get insights from their content. It’s a highly observable and heterogeneous system where a non-blocking programming model is being used for high throughput.

Here's an small set of the technologies used:

- Java
